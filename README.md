## How to Use Google SketchUp Pro 7
  
Google SketchUp Pro 7 is a user-friendly software that allows you to create 3D models of anything you can imagine. You can use the tools and features in the software to draw, edit, measure, color, texture, and animate your models. You can also import and export your models to other formats and applications.
  
To start using Google SketchUp Pro 7, you need to familiarize yourself with the interface and the basic concepts of the software. Here are some of the main elements of the interface:
  
- Menu bar: The menu bar contains various menus that let you access different commands and options in the software. You can use the menus to create, open, save, print, export, import, and customize your models and settings.
- Toolbars: The toolbars contain various icons that represent different tools and functions in the software. You can use the tools to draw, modify, view, and organize your models. You can also customize the toolbars by adding or removing icons according to your preference.
- Drawing area: The drawing area is where you create and edit your models. It consists of three main components: the axes, the origin, and the inference engine. The axes are three colored lines that represent the three dimensions of space: red for x-axis, green for y-axis, and blue for z-axis. The origin is the point where the three axes meet. The inference engine is a feature that helps you draw accurately by snapping your cursor to points, edges, faces, and guides in your model.
- Status bar: The status bar is located at the bottom of the interface. It shows you information about your model, such as dimensions, coordinates, angles, distances, and units. It also shows you tips and prompts for using the tools and functions in the software.
- Trays: The trays are panels that contain various windows that display additional information and options for your model. Some of the windows include: Entity Info, which shows you details about the selected entity in your model; Materials, which lets you apply colors and textures to your model; Layers, which lets you organize your model into different layers; Scenes, which lets you save and switch between different views of your model; Styles, which lets you change the appearance of your model; and Outliner, which lets you see the hierarchy of your model.

    To create a 3D model in Google SketchUp Pro 7, you need to follow these basic steps:
- Select a template: A template is a preset file that contains settings for your model, such as units, dimensions, background color, perspective, etc. You can choose a template from the welcome screen or from the File menu.
- Draw a 2D shape: A 2D shape is a flat figure that has length and width but no depth. You can use the drawing tools in the toolbar to draw a 2D shape on the drawing area. Some of the drawing tools include: Line, which lets you draw straight lines; Rectangle, which lets you draw rectangles; Circle, which lets you draw circles; Arc, which lets you draw arcs; Polygon, which lets you draw polygons; and Freehand, which lets you draw freehand curves.
- Pull it into 3D: A 3D shape is a solid figure that has length, width, and depth. You can use the Push/Pull tool in the toolbar to pull a 2D shape into 3D. To do this, select the tool, click on a face of the 2D shape, and drag it up or down along the blue axis. You can also type in a specific distance or use the inference engine to snap to a point or edge in your model.
- Modify it: You can use the modifying tools in the toolbar to change the shape and size of your 3D model. Some of the modifying tools include: Move, which lets you move entities in your model; Rotate, which lets you rotate entities in your model; Scale, which lets you resize entities in your model; Offset, which lets you create parallel copies of edges or faces in your model; and Follow Me, which lets you create complex shapes by extruding a face along a path in your model.
- Add details: You can use the detailing tools in the toolbar to add more features and realism to your 3D model. Some of the detailing tools include: Paint Bucket, which lets you apply colors and textures to your model; Text, which lets you add text labels to your model; Dimension, which lets you add dimension annotations to your model; 3D Text, which lets you create 3D text objects in your model; and Sandbox Tools, which let you create organic shapes and terrains in your model.
- Present it: You can use the presentation tools in the toolbar to view and share your 3D model. Some of the presentation tools include: Orbit, which lets you rotate the camera around your model; Pan, which lets you move the camera sideways in your model; Zoom, which lets you zoom in or out of your model; Walk, which lets you walk through your model; Look Around, which lets you look around your model; Section Plane, which lets you cut a section of your model to see inside it; and Camera, which lets you adjust the perspective and field of view of your model.
